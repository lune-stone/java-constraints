# java-constraints

A toy solver for [Constraint Satisfaction Problems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constraint_satisfaction_problem) designed to be easy to use.

## Getting Started

Take a look at the examples folder. [HelloWorld.java](src/test/java/com/lune/stone/constraints/examples/HelloWorld.java) is a good place to start.

### Installing

This project is not currently in any maven repositories. For now you can copy [Problem.java](src/main/java/com/lune/stone/constraints/Problem.java) to where you need it. Be sure to check the license if you plan to distribute.

## Contributing

I'm not planning to do much more with this project, as it has already accomplished it's original purpose of being a learning exercise. That said I still welcome any bug fixes, PRs, feature requests, etc. Just be aware that they will be low on my priorities.

If you are interested in maintaining or forking this project I would be willing to assist you in your efforts.

## Acknowledgments

Inspired by skimming the [python-contraint](http://labix.org/python-constraint) docs and failing to find a similar api in java after a brief web search.
